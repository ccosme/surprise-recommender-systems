# Recommender Systems using Surprise
Three proof of concept (PoC) domain-agnostic recommender systems. Item-based (item-item) and User-Item collaborative filtering models were built using the [Surprise](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise) library. A rank- or popularity-based model was also developed to deal with the *cold-start problem.*

## Data Sources
This project used a *small* dataset with ratings of [Amazon Software reviews](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). The dataset only includes item IDs, user IDs, ratings, and timestamps and does not include metadata or qualitative reviews.
